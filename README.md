## About the app

<i>Homeless people are everywhere, but they are often treated as a negative by the community. They are told to hide away by the same community that should be helping them, and that’s why for this year’s contest, we have developed an app to support these people.</i>

To create a decent app, we contacted local shelters in Leicestershire and used their comments to improve our app so that it could be used as a genuine product rather than just software for a contest. However, we also paid attention to those who are willing to assist - the volunteers.

Although the shelters and people who shared their stories preferred to remain anonymous, we are appreciative for their assistance and support.

To get a broader idea of what drives us - check out the video below. James explains the idea behind our app in great detail!
